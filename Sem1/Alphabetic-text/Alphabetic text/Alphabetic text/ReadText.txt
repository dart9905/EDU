My uncle by a good will featured,
When falling seriously ill,
Has turned into exacting creature
And could not make a better deal.
That’s for the others a good lesson,
But what a boredom is the session:
To watch a sick man day and night
And do not make a step aside!
What a deceitfulness it is
To dose the drugs avoiding smile,
To fluff the pillows looking shy,
Thus, entertain a half deceased
By showing sympathy, then, sigh
And think: when, God damn, will you die
That’s what reflected a scapegrace,
When a post-chase was speeding him,
He was by supreme Zeus’s grace
The only heir of all his kin.

Here is my novel’s in verse hero,
With no preface and just right now
Let me acquaint you with the one:
Eugene Onegin, my good fellow,
Was born on Neva’s even shores,
Which, probably, were home of yours,
Or where you used sometimes to revel.
It was a place, where I did stay,
But North is not for me, they say.

The friends of “Ruslan and Lyudmila
My uncle by a good will featured,
Thus, entertain a half deceased
He was by supreme Zeus’s grace
That’s what reflected a scapegrace,
And do not make a step aside!
And think: when, God damn, will you die
To dose the drugs avoiding smile,
Let me acquaint you with the one:
Has turned into exacting creature
By showing sympathy, then, sigh
And could not make a better deal.
Or where you used sometimes to revel.

Was born on Neva’s even shores,
What a deceitfulness it is
Which, probably, were home of yours,
To watch a sick man day and night
Eugene Onegin, my good fellow,
With no preface and just right now
It was a place, where I did stay,
To fluff the pillows looking shy,

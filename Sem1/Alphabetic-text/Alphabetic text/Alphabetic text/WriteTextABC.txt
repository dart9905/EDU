And could not make a better deal.
And do not make a step aside!
And think: when, God damn, will you die
But what a boredom is the session:
By showing sympathy, then, sigh
Eugene Onegin, my good fellow,
Has turned into exacting creature
He was by supreme Zeus’s grace
Here is my novel’s in verse hero,
It was a place, where I did stay,
Let me acquaint you with the one:
My uncle by a good will featured,
Or where you used sometimes to revel.
That’s for the others a good lesson,
That’s what reflected a scapegrace,
The friends of “Ruslan and Lyudmila
The only heir of all his kin.
Thus, entertain a half deceased
To dose the drugs avoiding smile,
To fluff the pillows looking shy,
To watch a sick man day and night
Was born on Neva’s even shores,
What a deceitfulness it is
When a post-chase was speeding him,
When falling seriously ill,
Which, probably, were home of yours,
With no preface and just right now
